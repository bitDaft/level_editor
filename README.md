 Furs Level editor
==============

A level editor for as of yet uncreated game ,Furs.

Created for terminal,  
since i dont know how to make gui,  
and it is easier on the shell


As of now,produces a grid (10x10)(cannot change size,will figure it out later)

 **arrow keys to navigate**    
 **Enter to toggle between create/destroy of object in grid cell**  
 **shows a list of cell values,their address,
 and next cell address they point to  **
